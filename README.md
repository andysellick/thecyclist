==========

This is a prototype for some further work that in time may need to move to a different language for speed and efficiency reasons. Code has not been properly optimised.

For now, it simulates traffic crossing a junction. Press '1' to change the lights (not visually implemented yet) and change the flow of traffic. Editing cyc_data.js allows the junction to be configured in different ways.

Much work still to be done.
